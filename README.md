# Govee DTH and Smartapp
This app creates a virtual device to control govee led in SmartThings.

## Limitation
### Status Sync
The Govee API does not support webhook or any push so If the state has changed externally, there is no way to apply it. Instead, this DTH polls the state every miniute. Therefore, if you use govee device directly or other app, it may take up to 5 minute for the status to be applied.

### Rate Limit of API
From govee API doc. 
```
For all requests, the rate limit allows for up to 100 requests per minute. 
Requests are associated with the originating IP address.
```

If the smartthings server has one IP and multiple people use this DTH, it can cause problems.  
If the number of users increases, I will modify it to use own IP by using a private relay server such as Docker.  

## Pre Requirement

You can get the API key in govee official app.

## Support
### Features
All functions provided by Govee API are supported.  
Some functions like mode change are not provided by the API, so DTH also does not support.
